  <div class="question">
    {{ Q: How does this test work? }}
  </div>

  <div class="answer">
    {{ The test is entirely client-side javascript. To determine reachability, a series of ajax requests are made from the
    web server, using various DNS names that force the use of IPv6 only, or dual stack, or other such scenarios. The
    pass/fail of such fetches, as well as how long they take, are taken into account. }}
  </div>

  <div class="question">
    {{ Q: Why is this web site reachable via IPv4 only? }}
  </div>

  <div class="answer">
    {{ You're right, there are no AAAA records, intentionally. A percentage of users are unable to browse sites that are
    dual-stack. If the users can't connect, then they can't be told they have a problem. This is a big problem facing
    content providers today; of which, I work at one for my &#36;dayjob. As such, the main test page requires IPv4 (either
    native or translated). }}
  </div>

  <div class="answer">
    {{ At some point, when the percentage of "broken" users has gone significantly down, I'll consider making
    test-ipv6.com dual-stack.  At least check, May 2013, we still see 0.5% broken
    visiting test-ipv6.com.  And we still want them to understand their
    situation. }}
  </div>

  <div class="question">
    {{ Q: How do I test my IPv6-only host }}
  </div>

  <div class="answer">
    {{ If you ask that question, chances are you don't need this site. However, if you really want to, visit <a href=
    "http://ipv6.test-ipv6.com">http://ipv6.test-ipv6.com</a> with your IPv6-only host. }}
  </div>

  <div class="question">
    {{ Q: What do you mean by broken? }}
  </div>

  <div class="answer">
    {{ A percentage of users today have IPv6 enabled, but are either using a public tunnel that is currently giving poor
    performance; or otherwise have a route that is installed but broken or suboptimal. However, because they have a
    route at all, in many cases the address selection algorithm of RFC3484 will pick using it, and trying to use this
    broken route. It can take towards 75+ seconds before the browser gives up! }}
  </div>

  <div class="answer">
    {{ From the perspective of a user with these conditions, a web site offering both A and AAAA DNS records (ie, "dual
    stack") will appear to time out; and the user will move on to another site that offers a similar product. This is
    the quandary content providers have. }}
  </div>
  <div class="answer">
    {{ If we detect that you will have problems reaching dual-stack web sites,
    we recommend you see the <a href="broken.html">Broken User FAQ</a>.  It
    provides several steps to try and identify your root cause for being
    broken; and barring that, what you can do to disable IPv6 until your ISP
    offers native IPv6 connectivity. }}
  </div>

  <div class="question">
    {{ Q: Why did your stats say you already have IPv6-only users? }}
  </div>

  <div class="answer">
    {{ They went to <a href="http://ipv6.test-ipv6.com">http://ipv6.test-ipv6.com</a> . }}
  </div>

  <div class="question">
    {{ Q: How valid are the stats? }}
  </div>

  <div class="answer">
    {{ They do not represent the average web consumer. Visitors to this site are self-selecting. The intent of this site
    is to not provide stats, but instead to inform the user the level of readiness for the world to move to IPv6 (with
    or without'em!). As such, stats found here will be completely different from an average content provider. }}
  </div>

  <div class="question">
    {{ Q: How does your test differ, from what the content providers are doing? }}
  </div>

  <div class="answer">
    {{ Content providers are gathering metrics of broken vs non-broken users, in an aggregate form. They are not at this
    time actually giving the user feedback as to the user's current state. Those metrics will principally drive the
    business decision of when to start publishing sites over IPv6, versus remaining IPv4 only. IPv4 only for some
    content sites really is an option; it has a handful of downsides, but the expectation is that everyone will always
    be able to reach IPv4, in some fashion. }}
  </div>

  <div class="answer">
    {{ This site, on the other hand, is intended to help the user understand their current state, and what that state
    possibly means to them. }}
  </div>

  <div class="question">
    {{ Q: Your site shows the wrong IP address; how can I bypass my proxy server to find my public address? }}
  </div>

  <div class="answer">
    {{ For ipv4/ipv6/dual stack, use one of these: }}

    <p><code>telnet ipv4.test-ipv6.com 79</code> {{ for ipv4 }}<br />
    <code>telnet ipv6.test-ipv6.com 79</code> {{ for ipv6 }}<br />
    <code>telnet ds.test-ipv6.com 79</code> {{ for either }}</p>

    <p>{{ Note you _may_ need to specify other options to your telnet command, depending on your operating system. On my
    mac, for example, I need to use "<code>telnet -6</code>". }}</p>
  </div>

  <div class="question">
    {{ Q: Do you actually read the feedback? }}
  </div>

  <div class="answer">
    <p>
    {{ Yes, I do. Thank you! Note that I can only follow up with you if you do leave contact information. While I am still
    grateful for feedback without contact information, I will be unable to reply with any answers if you asked for them. }}
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="question">
    {{ Q: How else can I contact you? }}
  </div>

  <div class="answer">
    {{ I would prefer you use the form, as it gives details of your connectivity, and bypasses any mail filters. }}
    {{ That said, you are welcome to directly email <a href="mailto:jfesler@test-ipv6.com">jfesler@test-ipv6.com</a>. }}
  </div>

  <div class="question">
    {{ Q: Is this open source? }}
  </div>
  
  <div class="answer">
    {{ Yes.  See the <a href="source.html">source page</a> for details. }}
