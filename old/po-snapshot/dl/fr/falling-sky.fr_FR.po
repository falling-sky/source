msgid "6RD tunnels have been designed by the IETF as <a href=\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5969\">RFC 5969</a> to be deployed within an ISP access network and by the ISP itself to transport IPv6 over a legacy IPv4 access network. As the tunnel is confined with a single ISP, it is therefore managed in such a way to provide performances as good in IPv6 as in IPv4 (except perhaps for the largest packet size, a.k.a. MTU)."
msgstr "Les tunnels 6RD ont été spécifiés par l'IETF en tant que <a href=\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5969\">RFC 5969</a> pour être déployés au travers du réseau d'accès d'un FAI et par ce FAI lui-même afin de transporer des paquets IPv6 au dessus de son réseau d'accès qui ne fournit que IPv4. Comme ce tunnel 6RD est confiné au sein d'un seul FAI, il est par conséquent géré et offre des performances strictement équivalentes en IPv6 qu'en IPv4 (sauf peut-être au niveau de la plus grande taille des paquets, c-à-d le MTU)."

msgid "During the tests, we collect your IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. If at least 16 bits of your IPv4 address are embedded in your IPv6 prefix, then we assume that you are using a 6RD tunnel."
msgstr "Lors de ces tests, nous déterminons vos adresses IPv4 et IPv6. Si au moins 16 bits de votre adresse IPv4 se retrouvent dans votre préfixe IPv6, nous supposons alors que vous utilisez un tunnel 6RD."
