AS long as the route is being advertised, and they are the \"closest\" (in a BGP network sense - not in your control), that particular relay is the one you MUST use. Same for the web site you're trying to use - they have the same constraints, but most likely using a different relay than you. If anything goes wrong, even if you or the web site can figure out which one it is, there is not a good way to get the problem fixed."
