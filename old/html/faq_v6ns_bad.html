<h1>[% " About the \"v6ns\" test. " | i18n %]</h1>

<p><i>[% " This FAQ has been produced to try and address what it means for the v6ns test to be \"bad\". " | i18n %]</i></p>

<p>[% " This test specifically verifies that your DNS resolver 
(usually operated by your Internet service provider, or your corporate IT department) is capable
of reaching IPv6 Internet sites for DNS lookups.  If you explicitly
configured the use of a different DNS server, such as OpenDNS or Google's
Public DNS, you'll test those services instead. " | i18n %]</p>

<p><b>[% " If this test fails: " | i18n %]</b>  
[% " it means that the DNS resolver you are using,
requires IPv4 to reach the DNS authoritative servers of your favorite web
sites.  In the near future, every web site of consequence will remain
accessible in this form, so <b>there is no immediate danger.</b> " | i18n %]</p>

<p><b>[% " If this test succeeds: " | i18n %]</b> [% " it means that your DNS resolver is fully
capable of reaching IPv6 DNS servers.  This means that the operator of that
DNS server has IPv6 within their network.  If they do not already offer you
IPv6, this may be a sign that they are actively working on trying to make it
possible. " | i18n %]</p>

<h2>[% " Do you use OpenDNS? " | i18n %]</h2>

<p>[% " OpenDNS is now offering  IPv6-specific resolvers, that will be able to
retrieve DNS over IPv6.  This means the \"v6ns\" test operated here will pass. 
See the <a target=_blank href=\"http://www.opendns.com/ipv6/\">OpenDNS IPv6
information page</a>. " | i18n %]</p>

<h2>[% " Do you operate your own DNS resolvers? " | i18n %]</h2>

<p> [% " If you operated the DNS
resolvers in use at your home or organization, enabling IPv6 on your DNS
server is easy. " | i18n %]</p>

<ul>
<li>[% " ISC BIND: Make sure that IPv6 support is compiled in when you
./configure it.  It is enabled by default.  If you recently added IPv6 to
your server, simply restart your named process, as you normally would. " | i18n %]</li>

<li>[% " PowerDNS: Enable <code>aaaa-additional-processing</code> and configure
<code>query-local-address6</code> in your <code>recursor.conf</code>. 
Restart powerdns. " | i18n %]</li>

<li>[% " Windows Server 2003: Upgrade to Windows Server 2008 at a minimum. 
Windows 2003 will resolve AAAA records, and supports IPv6 clients, but does
*not* do DNS resolution over IPv6. " | i18n %]</li>

</ul>

<p><b>[% " Confirmation: " | i18n %]</b>  <code>dig aaaa aaaa.v6ns.test-ipv6.com</code>
[% " should return back an aaaa record without errors. " | i18n %]</p>
