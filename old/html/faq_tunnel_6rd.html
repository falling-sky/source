<h1>[% " What is specific to 6RD tunnels? " | i18n %]</h1>

<p>
	[% " 6RD tunnels have been designed by the IETF as <a href=\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5969\">RFC 5969</a> to be
	deployed within an ISP access network and by the ISP itself to transport IPv6 over a legacy IPv4 access network.
	As the tunnel is confined with a single ISP, it is therefore managed in such a way to provide performances
	as good in IPv6 as in IPv4 (except perhaps for the largest packet size, a.k.a. MTU). " | i18n %]
</p>
<p>
	[% " In short, a 6RD tunnel provides you with native IPv6 connectivity. " | i18n %]
</p>

<h1>[% " How did we detect a 6RD tunnel? " | i18n %]</h1>
<p>
	[% " During the tests, we collect your IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. If at least 16 bits of your IPv4 address
	are embedded in your IPv6 prefix, then we assume that you are using a 6RD tunnel. " | i18n %]
