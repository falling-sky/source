  <div class="answer">
    <p>[% " When you go to your favorite web site in a browser, and it
    hangs for several seconds or even minutes. If the publisher
    publishes to IPv6, and your computer has a *broken* IPv6 route
    (as compared to having no route), then your computer will
    attempt to use that broken route first, before falling back to
    the IPv4 Internet. " | i18n %]</p>

  <div class="question">
    [% " What causes these timeouts? " | i18n %]
  </div>

  <div class="answer">
    <p>[% " Newer operating systems have IPv6 enabled by default. Older
    ones, may have IPv6 enabled, as a result of user action (or
    specific applications). Enabling IPv6 does not automatically
    make you vulnerable. " | i18n %]</p>

    <p>[% " The problem lies when your system is convinced to try and
    use IPv6, when it is not working adequately. This may be
    because you're using a public service for your IPv6 gateway.
    Or, someone on your network, was advertising (to the network)
    IPv6 through Internet connection sharing; and they left. Last,
    your router may have IPv6 automatically configured to use
    public unmanaged gateways; and is telling your computer to use
    it. " | i18n %]</p>

    <p>[% " The simplest, yet near-sighted, solution, would be just to
    disable IPv6. However, over the next couple of years, this will
    start to cause you more troubles than not. It would be best to
    instead find the root of your actual problem, and fix that
    instead. " | i18n %]</p>
