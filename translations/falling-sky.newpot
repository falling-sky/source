#: "faq_6to4.html"
msgid "With unmanaged 6to4 connections (created \"automatically\" or without explicit gateway information) the process is a fair bit different. IPv6 is put into an IPv4 packet - much like sticking a letter in an envelope. This packet is sent to the \"nearest available\" gateway. Your ISP<i>may</i> run one of these; most do not. Chances are the one you use, will be run by a good samaritan who's trying to contribute to the community.

AS long as the route is being advertised, and they are the \"closest\" (in a BGP network sense - not in your control), that particular relay is the one you MUST use. Same for the web site you're trying to use - they have the same constraints, but most likely using a different relay than you.
